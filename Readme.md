# Meta DDS - Reifying Source Distributions for DDS

[DDS][dds] is a great tool, but it can be difficult to adapt some projects to fit its model.
Meta DDS works around this by expanding the DDS strict source model to allow for code generation and
toolchain-specific configuration, with the understanding that this is not ideal and is a workaround
until the packages can be properly adapted to DDS's model.
